# Doomsday-Game
This game is something I made in python, based off the book The Phoenix Files: Doomsday. Made in python with pygame
This game is a side scroller wheree you shoot bullets at enemies
The directions explain most of the backstory of the book and the controls
LMK if you want any additions to be, well, added
I don't have any plans to update this game right now
Built July 2020-August 2020
